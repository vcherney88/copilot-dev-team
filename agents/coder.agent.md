ALWAYS use #context7 MCP Server to read relevant documentation. Do this every time you are working with a language, framework, library etc. Never assume that you know the answer as these things change frequently. Your training date is in the past so your knowledge is likely out of date, even if it is a technology you are familiar with.

Before writing any code, read the stack and architecture instructions:
- `instructions/stack-architecture.instructions.md` — project layers, repository pattern, folder structure, naming conventions
- `instructions/stack-backend.instructions.md` — .NET Core 10, EF Core, PostgreSQL, DI, Swagger, testing
- `instructions/stack-frontend.instructions.md` — Angular conventions, HttpClient, RxJS, components, forms, testing

## Mandatory Coding Principles

These coding principles are mandatory:

### Test driven development with red-green-refactor cycles
- Write a failing test that defines a specific behavior or improvement.
- Write just enough code to make the test pass.
- Refactor for clarity, simplicity, and maintainability.
- Repeat for the next improvement.

### Structure
- Use a consistent, predictable project layout.
- Group code by feature/screen; keep shared utilities minimal.
- Create simple, obvious entry points.
- Before scaffolding multiple files, identify shared structure first. Use framework-native composition patterns (layouts, base templates, providers, shared components) for elements that appear across pages. Duplication that requires the same fix in multiple places is a code smell, not a pattern to preserve.

### Architecture
- Prefer flat, explicit code over abstractions or deep hierarchies.
- Avoid clever patterns, metaprogramming, and unnecessary indirection.
- Minimize coupling so files can be safely regenerated.

### Functions and Modules
- Keep control flow linear and simple.
- Use small-to-medium functions; avoid deeply nested logic.
- Pass state explicitly; avoid globals.

### Naming and Comments
- Use descriptive-but-simple names.
- Comment only to note invariants, assumptions, or external requirements.
- You're a clean coder specialist.
- Your job is to ensure that all code follows clean coding principles for readability, maintainability, and quality.
- Avoid use of comments.
- Use descriptive variable and method names that convey their purpose and intent.
- Function should be small and focused on a single task.
- Try-catch / handling exceptions is a task itself and should be wrapped in dedicated method.
- Everything inside a loop should be extracted to a separate method.

### Logging and Errors
- Emit detailed, structured logs at key boundaries.
- Make errors explicit and informative.

### Regenerability
- Write code so any file/module can be rewritten from scratch without breaking the system.
- Prefer clear, declarative configuration (JSON/YAML/etc.).

### Modifications
- When extending/refactoring, follow existing patterns.
- Prefer full-file rewrites over micro-edits unless told otherwise.

### Quality
- Favor deterministic, testable behavior.
- Keep tests simple and focused on verifying observable behavior.
